  DEPRECATION: Legacy editable install of pyprogressivex==0.1 from file:///home/ddsm/DownLoad/DeepLSD/third_party/progressive-x (setup.py develop) is deprecated. pip 25.0 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to add a pyproject.toml or enable --use-pep517, and use setuptools >= 64. If the resulting installation is not behaving as expected, try using --config-settings editable_mode=compat. Please consult the setuptools documentation for more information. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11457

      Successfully uninstalled homography_est-0.0.0
  DEPRECATION: Legacy editable install of homography_est==0.0.0 from file:///home/ddsm/DownLoad/DeepLSD/third_party/homography_est (setup.py develop) is deprecated. pip 25.0 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to add a pyproject.toml or enable --use-pep517, and use setuptools >= 64. If the resulting installation is not behaving as expected, try using --config-settings editable_mode=compat. Please consult the setuptools documentation for more information.
